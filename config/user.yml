# user.yml — users who can talk to Core. Each user has: id, name, type (normal | companion), optional who (identity for companion-type).
# type "normal": can use channels (email, im, phone). type "companion": companion app / WebChat / control UI only; no channels.
# All users have per-user sandbox (base/{user_id}/), share folder, AGENT_MEMORY, daily memory, RAG memory, chat history, knowledge_base.
#
# Companion app "System" mode: add a user with id "companion" so AGENT_MEMORY, daily memory, chat, and sandbox work like any other user.
# Future roles (Math, Music, Sport): add users e.g. id: math_teacher, music, sport; same machinery (sandbox base/{user_id}/, per-user memory/chat).
#
# skill_api_keys: optional per-user API keys for keyed skills (maton-api-gateway, x-api, meta-social, hootsuite, weibo-api).
#   If missing for a user, that skill is not available for that user. Companion without user uses keys in the skill's config.yml / env directly.
# im: list of "<channel>:<id>" for IM channels. Core matches the request's channel identity against this list.
#   - Tinode: tinode:usrXXXX | WeChat: wechat:wxid | Telegram: telegram:<chat_id> | Discord: discord:<user_id>
#   - Matrix: matrix:@localpart:domain (e.g. matrix:@shileipeng:matrix.org) | QQ: qq:<number>
# For Email: add addresses to email:. For Phone/SMS: add numbers to phone:.
# permissions: e.g. [IM, EMAIL, PHONE] or [] to allow all.
