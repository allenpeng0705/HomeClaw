# Welcome to HomeClaw

**HomeClaw** is a **local-first AI assistant** that runs on your own hardware. Talk to it over the channels you already use—Telegram, Discord, WebChat, email, and more—or use the **Flutter companion app** (Mac, Windows, iPhone, Android) for chat, voice, and **Manage Core** (edit config from the app). Extend it with **built-in and external plugins** (any language: Node.js, Go, Java, Python, etc.) and **OpenClaw-style skills**. **Memory** is RAG + agent memory (AGENT_MEMORY.md, daily memory). **Multimodal** (images, audio, video) works with both **local models** and **cloud** (e.g. **Gemini**). **Multi-agent** = run multiple HomeClaw instances. Your data stays yours.
