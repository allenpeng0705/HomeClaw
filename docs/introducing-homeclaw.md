# Introducing HomeClaw

*Formal intro for the doc site. You can replace this with curated content from `docs_design/IntroducingHomeClaw.md` or write a shorter version.*

HomeClaw is a local-first AI assistant that runs on your machine. One installation is one agent: the same memory, tools, and plugins no matter how you connect (WebChat, Telegram, email, CLI, etc.).

- **Local-first** — Use local LLMs (llama.cpp, GGUF) so data stays at home; cloud (LiteLLM) is optional.
- **Channels** — Reach your assistant from Telegram, Discord, WeChat, WhatsApp, email, and more.
- **Memory** — RAG-based, per-user; the assistant can recall across sessions.
- **Plugins & skills** — Extend with plugins (Weather, News, Mail, custom) and OpenClaw-style skills.

For the full intro, see [IntroducingHomeClaw.md](https://github.com/allenpeng0705/HomeClaw/blob/main/docs_design/IntroducingHomeClaw.md) in the repo.
