HomeClaw started as **GPT4People**: local LLM for security, channels to reach your home computer simply. It grew to include RAG memory, major IMs (WeChat, WhatsApp), then cloud model support, a plugin framework, multi-user and multi-model design, and learning from OpenClaw (skills, ideas) while keeping local-first and privacy.
