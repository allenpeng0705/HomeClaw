# Companion plugin config — all companion behaviour lives here (not in Core).
# Character and language are what make the companion interesting and useful: they shape who the companion is and how they reply.
# Per-user overrides: database/companion_store/{user_id}_settings.json or POST .../settings/{user_id}
